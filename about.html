      <p>
        In school, I was that kid who seemed to be never paying attention. Seemingly in my own world of doodles and drawings.
        Things change right? when I came to college I got interested in studies and never missed a class in the 1st Semester and also got an award for that.
        Though I need to clarify you that i'm not that "Perfect student" type but I gave my best and completed things before the deadline and sometimes missed though.
        I consider myself a "Forever student". you know a quote? "If you stop learning you stop living" and so I would not stop learning and encourage you also to do so.
        My hobbies include reading books, wanna know my favorite one? "The Fault in our Starts" yes the one by John Green. I would not say myself as a "Movie-freak", but i do watch movies, my favorite movie is
        "The Pursuit of Happyness" yeah the one with Will Smith in it. I listen to music, mostly karaoke. I run daily, not run probably it's called jogging. <br>And that's about me.
